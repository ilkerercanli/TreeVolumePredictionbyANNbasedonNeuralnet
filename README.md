A R Shiny Application for Tree Volume Predictions based on Artificial Neural Network Models by Neuralnet in R: "An artificial neural network model, trained using the Neuralnet package coded in R language for single- and double-entry predictions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Black pine (Pinus nigra) trees, can be loaded through this program to obtain predictions for the diameter at breast height and heights of various trees."
